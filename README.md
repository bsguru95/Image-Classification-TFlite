# Image Classifer application using Flutter with TFlite

A new Flutter application which uses TFLite to enable on-device Machine Learning.

This app uses a machine learning model with mobilenetv2 dataset of images and labels. 
The app allows user to either upload image from gallery or capture a picture through camera and predicts what that image could possibly be according to its trained data.
